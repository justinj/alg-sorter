Cube Explorer and other tools usually output algs sorted by HTM (Half-turn Metric),
with superflouous (for most purposes) AUF turns before an after algs.
This is a tool that takes a list of algs (usually generated by Cubex) and optionally removes these turns,
and sorts the remaining algs by QTM (Quarter-turn Metric), removing duplicates.
